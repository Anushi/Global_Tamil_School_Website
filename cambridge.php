          Cambridge O Level Tamil is designed for learners who already have a
          working knowledge of the language and who want to consolidate, and
          develop further, their understanding to progress in their academic or
          professional careers. Learners will gain an understanding of how to
          use Tamil effectively in a type of situations, and Tamil-speaking
          environments, that they will encounter in their daily life. The aim is
          to enable learners to achieve greater fluency, accuracy and confidence
          in the written language and to achieve a level of practical
          communication which can also form the basis for further, more in-depth
          language study.
